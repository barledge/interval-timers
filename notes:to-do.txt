You've GOT to remember when functions are actually being called... USE what you know:

- Promises
- higher-order functions
- callbacks

To-Do:

- convert RunTimer to a Stateful Component
- its state will have the timer data, which will be referenced in the HTML
- the Redux store will be in charge of nothing in terms of the timer... it's all client-side
	-- the data, obviously, will still initially come from the store which will eventually be on the server

	TODAY wasn't a waste; it was a learning experience, as always.

	Read more.
	Plan more.
	Don't get discouraged.
	Build simple, but beautiful.
