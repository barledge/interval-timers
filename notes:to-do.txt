You've GOT to remember when functions are actually being called... USE what you know:

- Promises
- higher-order functions
- callbacks

To-Do:

FIRST and FOREMOS:
	-- get state from server on refresh
		a) middleware is already there; you need to...
			1) get setInitialState to launch immediately on a page refresh
			2) resubscribe store to updating the server on a page refresh
				currently it's in "Login" but... this should be changed to a helper function in componentWillMount() of App (routes)



1) login for:
	- google
	- twitter
	- linkedin

	-- logic to check if email already exists
		-- add emails: { } to firebase?

2) optimize saving the data so there aren't as many pings to the server
	- don't subscribe and do it manually on save-timer
		-- would have to refactor the setInitialState action/reducer
		-- what info about the timers do I want to actually be live-saved?
			a. currently saved timers
			b. timers
